# Docker-Container

ðŸ“¦ This is where I'll be learning about Docker, and how to create Docker containers.

## What is Docker?

â—¦ Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.
â—¦ Docker enables developers to separate our applications from our infrastructure so we can deliver software quickly
â—¦ Docker allows us to run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a **container**.

## Difference between Image and Container

â—¦ Docker images are read-only templates used to build containers
â—¦ Containers run the environment for Images
â—¦ Container has a port bound to it, which allows it to talk to the application to run inside of the container
â—¦ Containers are deployed instances created from the image templplates
